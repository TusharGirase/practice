# Comparing objects in JAVA

There are three ways to compare objects in java.

##Implementing Comparator interface.

	This interface is in java.util package as it provides a seperate way to sort the collection.
	You can have multiple ways to sort a collection using multiple implementations.
	No need to change the class itself which is going to be sorted.
	
##Implementing Comparable interface

	This interface is present in java.lang package.
	Provides single way to sort the collection.
