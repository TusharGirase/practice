#Method References
		
		You use lambda expressions to create anonymous methods.
		Sometimes, however, a lambda expression does nothing but call an existing method.
		In those cases, it's often clearer to refer to the existing method by name. 
		Method references enable you to do this; they are compact, easy-to-read lambda expressions for methods 		that already have a name.  
		
		
		Reference to a Static Method
		Reference to an Instance Method
		Reference to an Instance Method of an Object of a Particular Type
		Reference to a Constructor
