#Default and Static methods in Java 8

	 Static methods in Interface
	 	You can add static methods in a Interface
	 	You call them as InfName.methodName()
	 	You cannot override the static method.
	 	
	 Default methods in Interface
	 	Default keyword is added in java8
	 	You can override these methods
	 	Reengineering an existing JDK framework is always very complex.
	 	Modifying one interface in a JDK framework breaks all classes that extend the interface,
	 	which means that adding any new method could break millions of lines of code.
	 	Therefore, default methods have introduced as a mechanism to extend interfaces in a 
	 	backward-compatible way.
	 	The abstract class can define constructors.
	 	They are more structured and can have a state associated with them.
