#Dependency Inversion

	 The principle of Dependency Inversion refers to the decoupling of software modules. 
	 This way, instead of high-level modules depending on low-level modules, both will depend on abstractions.
	 High-level modules/classes should not depend on low-level modules/classes. Both should depend upon abstractions.
	 Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
